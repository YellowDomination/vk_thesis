relief	I-DIS

I	O

had	O
a	O

where	O
I	O
couldn	B-DIS

I	O

I	O

I	O

an	O

feel	O
about	O
the	O

The	O

was	O
really	O
huge	O

hard	B-DIS

swallow	I-DIS

I	O
have	O
taken	O
100mg	O

General	B-DIS
Anxiety	I-DIS
Disorder	I-DIS

It	O
has	O
helped	O
with	O
my	O
anxiety	B-DIS

the	O
physical	B-DIS
problems	I-DIS
as	O
a	O
result	O
of	O
my	O

Migrans	B-DIS

some	O

I	O

I	O
still	O
have	O
to	O
watch	O
what	O
I	O
eat	O

exercise	O
or	O
I	O
could	O
put	B-DIS
on	I-DIS
weight	I-DIS
.	O

I	O
think	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
weight	O
is	O
better	O
then	O
the	O
anxiety	B-DIS

stress	B-DIS

Overall	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
very	O
satisfied	O

I	O
used	O
Paxil	B-MED

found	O
Cymbalta	B-MED

for	O
2	O
months	O

it	O
works	O
fine	O
