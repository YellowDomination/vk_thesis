I	O

that	O

I	O
switched	O
to	O
the	O

My	O

I	O
would	O
say	O
the	O
first	O

were	O
somewhat	O
effective	O

unfortunately	O

this	O

I	O
take	O

I	O
will	O
be	O
asking	O
my	O

to	O
please	O
change	O
the	O
Nucynta	B-MED
as	O
the	O

are	O
not	O
worth	O
enduring	O
while	O
there	O
is	O
no	B-DIS

this	O
drug	O
was	O
prescribed	O
to	O
me	O
because	O
I	O
have	O
multiple	B-DIS

the	O

was	O
put	O
on	O
20	O
mg	O
a	O
day	O

and	O
the	O
first	O

it	O
reduced	B-DIS
my	I-DIS
total	I-DIS
cholesterol	I-DIS
by	I-DIS
about	I-DIS
125	I-DIS

Soon	O
after	O
,	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
have	O
dizziness	B-DIS

headaches	B-DIS

then	O
a	O
progressively	O
worsening	O
weakness	B-DIS
in	I-DIS
my	I-DIS

and	O
severe	B-DIS
cramping	I-DIS

It	O
was	O

with	O
the	O
worst	O
pain	B-DIS
in	I-DIS
my	I-DIS
feet	I-DIS

which	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
acting	O

There	O
were	O
times	O

I	O

bend	I-DIS
over	I-DIS

a	O

when	O
I	O
didn	O
'	O
t	O
know	O
if	O
I	O
could	O
move	O
without	O

It	O
was	O

telling	O
my	O
legs	O
to	O
move	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
refusing	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
also	O
taking	O
melodica	B-MED
for	O
arthritis	B-DIS
,	O
and	O
I	O
sent	O
a	O
message	O
to	O
my	O
doctor	O
that	O
I	O
thought	O
the	O
melodica	B-MED
was	O
causing	O
the	O
problems	O
.	O

I	O
didn	O
'	O
t	O
hear	O
anything	O
from	O
him	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
quit	O
the	O
melodica	B-MED
but	O
continued	O
with	O
the	O
simvastatin	B-MED
.	O

My	O
condition	O
got	O
worse	O
.	O

Then	O
I	O
just	O
quit	O
taking	O
the	O
simvastatin	B-MED
,	O
and	O
within	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
the	O
problems	O
began	O
to	O
clear	O
up	O

Every	O
day	O
since	O

things	O
have	O
gotten	O
better	O

and	O
I	O
am	O
back	O
on	O
the	O
melodica	B-MED
with	O
no	O
side	O
effects	O

I	O
conclude	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
simvastatin	B-MED
that	O
caused	O
the	O
problems	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
doctor	O
now	O
seems	O
to	O
agree	O

I	O

possibly	O
go	O
on	O
a	O
time	O
release	O
Niacin	B-MED

I	O
should	O

Zocor	B-MED
many	O

I	O
urge	O
anyone	O
who	O

taking	O
either	O
Zocor	B-MED

the	O
generic	O
simvastatin	O
to	O
watch	O

carefully	O

At	O

anything	I-DIS

I	O
take	O
nucynta	B-MED
for	O
severe	B-DIS
back	I-DIS

and	O
sciatica	B-DIS
.	O

I	O
only	O
take	O
it	O
occasionally	O

it	O
makes	O
me	O
too	O

to	I-DIS
work	I-DIS
or	I-DIS
drive	I-DIS

I	O
work	O

an	O

I	O
only	O
take	O
it	O
at	O

rarely	O
because	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
I	O
feel	B-DIS
sleepy	I-DIS
and	O
tired	B-DIS

It	O
is	O

effective	O
,	O
but	O
there	O
are	O
times	O
when	O
nothing	O
helps	O
the	O
pain	B-DIS

It	O
is	O
more	O

anything	O

the	O
doctors	O

I	O
just	O
can	O
'	O
t	O
use	O
it	O
regularly	O
because	O
I	O
need	O
to	O
stay	O

so	O
mostly	O
I	O
just	O
try	O

Dr	O

stop	O

the	O
Zocor	B-MED

I	O
will	O
try	O
another	O

This	O
medication	O
was	O
suggested	O
by	O
my	O
ENT	O
doctor	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
stop	B-DIS
my	I-DIS
cough	I-DIS
,	O
which	O
resulted	O
from	O
my	O
production	O
of	O
constant	B-DIS
mucous	I-DIS
.	O

It	O
works	O
quite	O
well	O
,	O
and	O
relieves	B-DIS
the	I-DIS
cough	I-DIS
.	O

However	O
,	O
after	O
one	O
week	O
of	O
using	O
the	O
highest	O
recommended	O
dosage	O
,	O
I	O
developed	O
diarrhea	B-DIS

This	O
has	O

reported	O

I	O
have	O
no	O

But	O
after	O
one	O
week	O
,	O
I	O
experienced	O
nausea	B-DIS
and	O
diarrhea	B-DIS
.	O

This	O
is	O
unfortunate	O
because	O
the	O
drug	O
works	O
quite	O
well	O
to	O
accomplish	O
the	O
objective	O
of	O
reducing	O

One	O
of	O
the	O
side	O
effects	O
I	O
experienced	O
were	O
some	O
night	B-DIS

though	O
,	O
they	O
could	O
be	O
due	O
to	O
my	O

side	O

that	O
never	O

didn	O

That	O
is	O
why	O

it	O
,	O
you	O
feel	B-DIS

You	O

So	O
I	O
was	O
sick	B-DIS
of	I-DIS
feeling	I-DIS
like	I-DIS
a	I-DIS
junkie	I-DIS
on	O
top	O
of	O
my	O
severe	B-DIS
pain	I-DIS
issues	I-DIS
.	O

Methadone	B-MED
has	O
given	O
me	O
my	O
life	O
back	O
.	O

There	O
has	O
been	O
no	O
side	O
effects	O
like	O
on	O
opiates	O
and	O
I	O
take	O
about	O
15	O
mg	O
a	O

vs	O
.	O
60	O
-	O
80mg	O
a	O
day	O
of	O
percocet	B-MED

This	O
is	O
amazing	O
I	O
even	O
tried	O
suboxone	B-MED
,	O
but	O
it	O
didn	B-DIS
'	I-DIS
t	I-DIS
control	I-DIS
my	I-DIS
pain	I-DIS

didn	O
'	O
t	O
stop	O
the	O
physical	B-DIS
craving	I-DIS
for	O
the	O
drugs	O
every	O
few	O
hours	O
or	O
so	O
despite	O
the	O
need	O
for	O
it	O
due	O
to	O
pain	B-DIS

This	O
is	O
the	O
way	O
to	O
go	O
if	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
manage	O
your	O
pain	B-DIS
and	O
not	O
become	O

Unfortunately	O
a	O

seem	O
to	O
have	O
any	O

it	O

now	O

I	O
smoked	O
for	O
38	O

I	O
damaged	B-DIS

I	O
have	O

I	O

I	O
weaned	O

experienced	O

5mg	O

I	O
first	O
noticed	O
hip	B-DIS
pain	I-DIS
after	O
excercise	O
and	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
night	B-DIS
leg	I-DIS
cramps	I-DIS

I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
it	O
around	O
3	O
months	O
ago	O
because	O
of	O
extreme	O
hip	B-DIS
pain	I-DIS
.	O

I	O
can	B-DIS
hardly	I-DIS
get	I-DIS
off	I-DIS

I	O
must	O
stop	O
and	O
rest	O
when	O
on	O
a	O
short	O

.	O

The	O
extreme	O
hip	B-DIS
pain	I-DIS
has	I-DIS
subsided	I-DIS
somewhat	O
but	O
not	O
enough	O
to	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
enjoy	O
a	O
walk	O
or	O
even	O
due	O
my	O
housework	O
.	O

I	O
wish	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
paid	O
more	O
attention	O
to	O
what	O
my	O
body	B-DIS
was	I-DIS
screaming	I-DIS
.	O

I	O
pray	O
that	O
this	O
pain	B-DIS
will	O
go	O
away	O
but	O
I	O
am	O
very	O
concerned	O
.	O

I	O
know	O
my	O
doctor	O
will	O
want	O
to	O
tests	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
know	O
crestor	B-MED

I	O
found	O
this	O
drug	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
effective	O
.	O

I	O
purchased	O
the	O
one	O
used	O
to	O
treat	O
irritated	B-DIS
bronchial	I-DIS
tubes	I-DIS
to	O
relieve	B-DIS
cough	I-DIS
and	O
to	O
thin	B-DIS
mucus	I-DIS
.	O

This	O
worked	O
great	O
for	O
me	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
short	O
time	O
and	O
I	O
feel	O
certain	O
kept	O
my	O
illness	B-DIS
from	O
turning	O
into	O
something	O
more	O
serious	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
not	O
used	O
the	O
one	O
which	O
is	O
for	O
chest	B-DIS
congestion	I-DIS

I	O
have	O
Gerd	B-DIS
and	O
I	O
cannot	O
take	O
too	O
much	O
of	O
this	O
.	O

What	O
I	O
found	O
effective	O
is	O
to	O
take	O
2	O
.	O
5	O
mg	O
under	O
the	O
tongue	O
which	O
works	O
in	O
about	O
30	O
min	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
wake	O
up	O
half	O
way	O
through	O
the	O
night	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
bathroom	O
.	O

So	O
I	O
take	O
another	O
2	O
.	O
5	O
mg	O
under	O
the	O
tongue	O
and	O
all	O
is	O
great	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
alternate	O
nights	O
with	O
10	O
mg	O
of	O
Melatonin	B-MED
because	O
the	O
Zolpidem	B-MED
exacerbates	B-DIS
the	I-DIS
gerd	I-DIS
and	O
also	O
makes	O
me	O
very	O
tired	B-DIS
throughout	O
the	O
day	O
.	O

So	O
only	O
doing	O
a	O
total	O
of	O
5	O
mg	O
three	O
times	O
a	O
week	O
then	O
alternating	O
with	O
10mg	O
of	O
melatonin	B-MED
3x	O
per	O
week	O
is	O
much	O
easier	O
on	O
my	O
system	O
.	O

Not	O

if	O
taking	O
this	O
under	O
the	O
tongue	O
is	O
bad	O
for	O
the	O
gerd	B-DIS

The	O

we	O
had	O
to	O
increase	O
the	O

10	O

I	O
found	O
that	O
when	O
I	O
took	O
the	O

nightly	O

many	O

I	O
awoke	B-DIS

It	O

it	O

well	O
to	O
manage	O
my	O

from	O
a	O

The	O
side	O
effects	O
have	O

in	O

My	O
pain	B-DIS
is	I-DIS
not	I-DIS
completely	I-DIS

but	O
it	O
is	O
masked	B-DIS

It	O

"	I-DIS

"	I-DIS
as	O
other	O
pain	O
meds	O

Also	O
,	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
a	O

easier	B-DIS
on	I-DIS
my	I-DIS
stomach	I-DIS
than	O
other	O
pain	O
meds	O

My	O
doctor	O
initially	O
prescribed	O
10	O

Shortly	O
after	O
I	O
became	O
aware	O
of	O
severe	B-DIS
leg	I-DIS
and	I-DIS
back	I-DIS
pain	I-DIS
,	O
but	O
did	O
not	O

On	O

He	O
did	O
not	O
consider	O
this	O
significant	O

After	O
another	O
blood	O
test	O
showed	O
my	O
cholesterol	B-DIS
went	I-DIS
down	I-DIS
from	I-DIS
over	I-DIS
300	I-DIS
to	I-DIS
247	I-DIS
,	O
he	O
still	O
felt	B-DIS
that	I-DIS

increased	O
my	O

to	O
20	O

I	O
took	O
this	O
medicine	O
this	O
due	O
to	O
a	O
bad	O
sinus	B-DIS
infection	I-DIS
with	O
thick	B-DIS
mucous	I-DIS
coming	I-DIS
up	I-DIS
and	O
a	O
strong	O
cough	B-DIS

I	O
think	O
the	O
effects	O
of	O
this	O
medicine	O
must	O
be	O
widely	O
varied	O
from	O
person	O
to	O
person	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
had	O
two	O
broken	B-DIS
ankles	I-DIS
(	O
severe	O
),	O
and	O
also	O
fibromyalgia	B-DIS
(	O
which	O
I	O
never	O
had	O
before	O
the	O
ankle	B-DIS
breads	I-DIS
).	O

I	O
have	O
ALWAYS	O
had	O
problems	O
with	O
pain	O
meds	O
.	O

Oxycodone	B-MED
and	O
Percocet	B-MED
do	O
not	O
work	O
,	O
neither	O
did	O
tragasol	B-MED
.	O

Morphine	B-MED
works	O
but	O
makes	O
me	O
dizzy	B-DIS
,	O
I	O
cannot	B-DIS
walk	I-DIS
or	I-DIS
speak	I-DIS
correctly	I-DIS
,	O
and	O
I	O
get	B-DIS
stupid	I-DIS
(	O
I	O
dont	O
know	O
any	O
other	O
way	O
to	O
say	O
it	O
).	O

Nucynta	B-MED
has	O
worked	O
well	O
for	O
me	O
,	O
with	O
no	O
noticeable	O
side	O
effects	O
.	O

It	O
works	O
better	O
for	O
the	O
fibromyalgia	B-DIS
then	O
the	O
pain	B-DIS
in	I-DIS
my	I-DIS
ankles	I-DIS
(	O
which	O
I	O
will	O
never	O
have	O
full	O
use	O
of	O
again	O
).	O

I	O
can	O
take	O
it	O
ever	O
four	O
hours	O
@	O
50mg	O
but	O
what	O
I	O
usually	O
do	O
is	O
take	O
two	O
twice	O
a	O
day	O
(	O
which	O
I	O
did	O
tell	O
my	O
pain	O
management	O
dr	O
).	O

That	O
seems	O
to	O
work	O
better	O
so	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
just	O
need	O
a	O
higher	O
dose	O
to	O
really	O
eliminate	O
my	O
ankle	B-DIS
pain	I-DIS

At	O
first	O
I	O

it	O
because	O
I	O
didn	O
'	O
t	O
want	O
to	O
become	O
addicted	B-DIS
