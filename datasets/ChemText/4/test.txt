I	O

with	O
thick	B-DIS

a	O

I	O
think	O
the	O
effects	O
of	O
this	O
medicine	O
must	O
be	O
widely	O
varied	O
from	O
person	O
to	O
person	O

I	O
have	O
had	O
two	O

also	O
fibromyalgia	B-DIS
(	O
which	O
I	O
never	O
had	O
before	O
the	O
ankle	B-DIS
breads	I-DIS
).	O

I	O
have	O
ALWAYS	O
had	O
problems	O
with	O
pain	O
meds	O
.	O

Oxycodone	B-MED
and	O
Percocet	B-MED
do	O
not	O
work	O
,	O
neither	O
did	O
tragasol	B-MED

Morphine	B-MED
works	O
but	O
makes	O
me	O
dizzy	B-DIS
,	O
I	O
cannot	B-DIS
walk	I-DIS
or	I-DIS
speak	I-DIS
correctly	I-DIS
,	O
and	O
I	O
get	B-DIS
stupid	I-DIS
(	O
I	O
dont	O
know	O
any	O

way	O
to	O

it	O

Nucynta	B-MED
has	O
worked	O
well	O
for	O
me	O
,	O
with	O
no	O
noticeable	O
side	O
effects	O
.	O

It	O
works	O
better	O
for	O
the	O
fibromyalgia	B-DIS
then	O
the	O
pain	B-DIS
in	I-DIS
my	I-DIS
ankles	I-DIS
(	O
which	O
I	O
will	O
never	O
have	O
full	O
use	O
of	O
again	O
).	O

I	O
can	O
take	O
it	O
ever	O
four	O
hours	O
@	O
50mg	O
but	O
what	O
I	O
usually	O
do	O
is	O
take	O
two	O
twice	O
a	O
day	O
(	O
which	O
I	O
did	O
tell	O
my	O
pain	O
management	O
dr	O
).	O

That	O
seems	O
to	O
work	O
better	O
so	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
just	O
need	O
a	O
higher	O
dose	O
to	O
really	O
eliminate	O
my	O
ankle	B-DIS

depression	B-DIS

It	O
all	O
started	O
about	O
a	O
year	O

I	O
was	O
out	O

2	O
months	O

I	O

100mg	O

Zoloft	B-MED
daily	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
a	O

afternoon	O
but	O
it	O
does	O
it	O
'	O
s	O
job	O

The	O
only	O
side	O
effect	O
is	O
once	O
in	O
awhile	O
I	O
get	O
dizzy	B-DIS
when	O
I	O
turn	O
my	O
head	O
but	O
I	O
can	O
live	O
with	O

I	O
recommend	O
this	O
drug	O
to	O
anyon	O
but	O
only	O
in	O
small	O
doses	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
was	O
at	O
the	O
height	O
of	O
my	O
depression	O
and	O
close	O
to	O
being	O
hospitalized	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
on	O
2mg	O
and	O
it	O
really	O
effected	B-DIS
my	I-DIS
motor	I-DIS
skills	I-DIS
.	O

I	O
was	O
also	O
on	O
Lerezapam	B-MED
for	O
anxiety	B-DIS
and	O
sleep	B-DIS
.	O

You	O
take	O
one	O
pill	O
and	O
20	O
minutes	O
you	O
are	O
sleeping	B-DIS
very	I-DIS
soundly	I-DIS
.	O

Nothing	O
could	O
wake	O
you	O
.	O

Very	O
good	O
drug	O
while	O
you	O
are	O
getting	B-DIS
out	I-DIS
of	I-DIS
depression	I-DIS
and	O
anxiety	B-DIS

Responding	O
to	O
someone	O
who	O
wondered	O
what	O
would	O
happen	O
if	O
they	O
went	O
off	O
the	O
drug	O
.	O

I	O
used	O
it	O
to	O
lose	B-DIS
weight	I-DIS
for	O
my	O
daughter	O
'	O
s	O
wedding	O
but	O
when	O
I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
it	O
I	O
kept	O
exercising	O
and	O
eating	O
right	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
at	O
least	O
maintained	B-DIS
the	I-DIS
weight	I-DIS
loss	I-DIS
of	I-DIS
21	I-DIS
pounds	I-DIS
.	O

I	O
basically	O
used	O
it	O
to	O
jumpstart	O
me	O
at	O
a	O
point	O
where	O
I	O
had	O
plateaued	O
.	O

The	O
wedding	O
was	O
7	O
months	O
ago	O
and	O
I	O
have	O
long	O
since	O
lost	O
the	O
commitment	O
to	O
my	O
weight	B-DIS
loss	I-DIS
regime	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
did	O
gain	B-DIS
all	I-DIS
but	I-DIS
ten	I-DIS
pounds	I-DIS
back	I-DIS
.	O

Although	O
I	O
am	O
exercising	O
and	O
dieting	O
again	O
I	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O
"	O
stuck	O
",	O
so	O
my	O
doctor	O
gave	O
me	O
a	O
new	O
prescription	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
hoping	O
I	O
will	O
have	O
good	O
results	O
again	O
.	O

To	O
diet	O
and	O
exercise	O
faithfully	O
with	O
zero	O
results	O
is	O
discouraging	O
.	O

And	O
,	O
as	O
my	O
doctor	O
explained	O
,	O
this	O
drug	O
was	O
originally	O
developed	O
to	O
treat	O
depression	B-DIS
,	O
and	O
the	O
side	O
effect	O
was	O
weight	B-DIS
loss	I-DIS
,	O
so	O
they	O
started	O
to	O
market	O
it	O
for	O
weight	B-DIS
loss	I-DIS
purposes	O
instead	O
.	O

And	O
so	O
,	O
an	O
added	O
benefit	O
may	O
be	O
less	B-DIS
depression	I-DIS
,	O
but	O
who	O
knows	O
if	O
that	O
is	O
a	O
result	O
of	O
the	O
drug	O
or	O
a	O
result	O
of	O
looking	O

to	I-DIS
get	I-DIS
the	I-DIS

normally	I-DIS

I	O
had	O

the	O
pain	B-DIS
decreased	I-DIS

I	O
took	O
this	O
medication	O
not	O
for	O

because	O
I	O
