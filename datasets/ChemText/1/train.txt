my	O

I	O
found	O
that	O

so	O
I	O
switched	O
to	O
the	O
600mg	O

If	O

far	O
in	O
stopping	B-DIS
my	I-DIS

I	O
also	O
was	O

a	O
ridiculous	O
relationship	O
with	O
a	O

I	O
never	O
would	O
have	O
been	O

for	O
the	O
xanax	B-MED

I	O
found	O
that	O
I	O
loved	O
everyone	O

the	O

was	O
rosy	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
didn	O
'	O

Now	O
I	O
cannot	B-DIS

After	O
all	O
these	O
years	O
of	O

I	O
have	O
no	O
idea	O
what	O
my	O

and	O
often	O
wonder	O
how	O

my	O
life	O
would	O
have	O
turned	O
out	O
without	O
xanax	B-MED

This	O
medicine	O
works	O
great	O
to	O
break	B-DIS
down	I-DIS
a	I-DIS
cough	I-DIS

The	O
only	O
side	O
effects	O
I	O
'	O

experienced	O
is	O
I	O
get	O

I	O
came	O
down	O

After	O
taking	O
Mucinex	B-MED
DM	I-MED
my	O
cough	B-DIS
was	I-DIS
producing	I-DIS
and	O
much	O
needed	O
loosening	O

mucus	B-DIS
build	I-DIS
up	I-DIS
in	I-DIS
my	I-DIS
chest	I-DIS

Yes	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
tired	O
while	O
taking	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
attribute	O
this	O
to	O
just	O
being	B-DIS
sick	I-DIS

I	O
took	O
this	O
for	O
2	O
months	O
only	O
and	O
lost	B-DIS
26	I-DIS
lbs	I-DIS
.	O

It	O
really	O
worked	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
magic	O
pill	O
I	O
worked	O
out	O
5	O
days	O
a	O
week	O

It	O
does	O
make	O
your	O
mouth	B-DIS
very	I-DIS

The	O
drug	O
takes	O
effect	O
quite	O
quickly	O
(	O
about	O
15	O
minutes	O

so	O
I	O

I	O

I	O

I	O
was	O

I	O
was	O
just	O

I	O
felt	B-DIS

I	O
think	O
I	O
was	B-DIS
eating	I-DIS
soap	I-DIS

something	I-DIS
weird	I-DIS

I	O
found	O
it	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
effective	O
for	O
me	O

I	O
took	O
the	O
600mg	O
once	O
every	O
twelve	O

noticed	O
a	O
significant	O
difference	O

I	O
will	O

that	O
I	O
found	O
it	O
equally	O
important	O
to	O

as	O
it	O
really	O
helped	O

I	O
smoked	O

When	O
I	O
first	O
started	O

Lexapro	B-MED

seem	O
to	O
go	O
through	O
different	O
levels	B-DIS
of	I-DIS

will	O

found	O
to	O

as	O

it	O
is	O
better	O
to	O

an	O

The	O
only	O
reason	O
I	O
gave	O
three	O
stars	O
on	O
effectiveness	O
is	O
due	O
to	O

I	O
have	O
always	O
been	O
a	O

this	O
was	O

I	O
weaned	O
myself	O
off	O
Lexapro	B-MED

then	O
experienced	O
a	O

in	O

My	O

I	O
would	O
take	O
the	O

Lexapro	B-MED
was	O
great	O
while	O
it	O

Pristiq	B-MED

a	O

5mg	O

I	O
first	O
noticed	O

pain	I-DIS
after	O
excercise	O
and	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
night	B-DIS
leg	I-DIS
cramps	I-DIS

I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
it	O
around	O

because	O
of	O
extreme	O
hip	B-DIS
pain	I-DIS

I	O
can	B-DIS

The	O
extreme	O
hip	B-DIS
pain	I-DIS
has	I-DIS
subsided	I-DIS
somewhat	O
but	O
not	O
enough	O
to	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
enjoy	O
a	O

or	O
even	O
due	O
my	O

I	O
wish	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
paid	O
more	O
attention	O
to	O
what	O
my	O
body	B-DIS
was	I-DIS
screaming	I-DIS
.	O

I	O
pray	O
that	O
this	O
pain	B-DIS
will	O
go	O
away	O
but	O
I	O
am	O
very	O
concerned	O
.	O

I	O
know	O
my	O
doctor	O
will	O
want	O
to	O
tests	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
know	O
crestor	B-MED

I	O
found	O
this	O
drug	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
effective	O
.	O

I	O
purchased	O
the	O
one	O
used	O
to	O
treat	O
irritated	B-DIS
bronchial	I-DIS
tubes	I-DIS
to	O
relieve	B-DIS
cough	I-DIS
and	O
to	O
thin	B-DIS
mucus	I-DIS
.	O

This	O
worked	O
great	O
for	O
me	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
short	O
time	O
and	O
I	O
feel	O
certain	O
kept	O
my	O
illness	B-DIS
from	O
turning	O
into	O
something	O
more	O
serious	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
not	O
used	O
the	O
one	O
which	O
is	O
for	O
chest	B-DIS
congestion	I-DIS

I	O
have	O
Gerd	B-DIS
and	O
I	O
cannot	O
take	O
too	O
much	O
of	O
this	O
.	O

What	O
I	O
found	O
effective	O
is	O
to	O
take	O
2	O
.	O
5	O
mg	O
under	O
the	O
tongue	O
which	O
works	O
in	O
about	O
30	O
min	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
wake	O
up	O
half	O
way	O
through	O
the	O
night	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
bathroom	O
.	O

So	O
I	O
take	O
another	O
2	O
.	O
5	O
mg	O
under	O
the	O
tongue	O
and	O
all	O
is	O
great	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
alternate	O
nights	O
with	O
10	O
mg	O
of	O
Melatonin	B-MED
because	O
the	O
Zolpidem	B-MED
exacerbates	B-DIS
the	I-DIS
gerd	I-DIS
and	O
also	O
makes	O
me	O
very	O
tired	B-DIS
throughout	O
the	O
day	O
.	O

So	O
only	O
doing	O
a	O
total	O
of	O
5	O
mg	O
three	O
times	O
a	O
week	O
then	O
alternating	O
with	O
10mg	O
of	O
melatonin	B-MED
3x	O
per	O
week	O
is	O
much	O
easier	O
on	O
my	O
system	O
.	O

Not	O
sure	O
if	O
taking	O
this	O
under	O
the	O
tongue	O
is	O
bad	O
for	O
the	O
gerd	B-DIS

My	O

it	O

the	O
only	O
medication	O
that	O
has	O

this	O

it	O
a	O

As	O

we	O
had	O
to	O
increase	O
the	O
dosage	O
to	O
10	O

I	O
found	O
that	O
when	O
I	O
took	O
the	O
drug	O
nightly	O

many	O
mornings	O
I	O
awoke	B-DIS

it	O

I	O

Well	O
I	O
ended	O

about	O
the	O

I	O
have	O

It	O

my	O

the	O

I	O
think	O
a	O

I	O

with	O
thick	B-DIS

coming	I-DIS
up	I-DIS

a	O
strong	O

I	O
think	O
the	O
effects	O
of	O
this	O
medicine	O
must	O
be	O
widely	O
varied	O
from	O
person	O
to	O
person	O

I	O
have	O
had	O
two	O

and	O
also	O
fibromyalgia	B-DIS
(	O
which	O
I	O
never	O
had	O
before	O
the	O
ankle	B-DIS
breads	I-DIS
).	O

I	O
have	O
ALWAYS	O
had	O
problems	O
with	O
pain	O
meds	O
.	O

Oxycodone	B-MED
and	O
Percocet	B-MED
do	O
not	O
work	O
,	O
neither	O
did	O
tragasol	B-MED

Morphine	B-MED
works	O
but	O
makes	O
me	O
dizzy	B-DIS
,	O
I	O
cannot	B-DIS
walk	I-DIS
or	I-DIS
speak	I-DIS
correctly	I-DIS
,	O
and	O
I	O
get	B-DIS
stupid	I-DIS
(	O
I	O
dont	O
know	O
any	O

way	O
to	O
say	O
it	O
).	O

Nucynta	B-MED
has	O
worked	O
well	O
for	O
me	O
,	O
with	O
no	O
noticeable	O
side	O
effects	O
.	O

It	O
works	O
better	O
for	O
the	O
fibromyalgia	B-DIS
then	O
the	O
pain	B-DIS
in	I-DIS
my	I-DIS
ankles	I-DIS
(	O
which	O
I	O
will	O
never	O
have	O
full	O
use	O
of	O
again	O
).	O

I	O
can	O
take	O
it	O
ever	O
four	O
hours	O
@	O
50mg	O
but	O
what	O
I	O
usually	O
do	O
is	O
take	O
two	O
twice	O
a	O
day	O
(	O
which	O
I	O
did	O
tell	O
my	O
pain	O
management	O
dr	O
).	O

That	O
seems	O
to	O
work	O
better	O
so	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
just	O
need	O
a	O
higher	O
dose	O
to	O
really	O
eliminate	O
my	O
ankle	B-DIS
pain	I-DIS

Zoloft	B-MED
daily	O
and	O
I	O

now	O
I	O

and	O
afternoon	O
but	O
it	O
does	O
it	O
'	O
s	O
job	O

The	O
only	O
side	O
effect	O
is	O
once	O
in	O
awhile	O
I	O
get	O
dizzy	B-DIS
when	O
I	O
turn	O
my	O
head	O
but	O
I	O
can	O
live	O
with	O
that	O

I	O
recommend	O
this	O
drug	O
to	O
anyon	O
but	O
only	O
in	O
small	O
doses	O

When	O
I	O
was	O
at	O
the	O
height	O
of	O
my	O
depression	O
and	O
close	O
to	O
being	O
hospitalized	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
on	O
2mg	O
and	O
it	O
really	O
effected	B-DIS
my	I-DIS
motor	I-DIS
skills	I-DIS
.	O

I	O
was	O
also	O
on	O
Lerezapam	B-MED
for	O
anxiety	B-DIS
and	O
sleep	B-DIS
.	O

You	O
take	O
one	O
pill	O
and	O
20	O
minutes	O
you	O
are	O
sleeping	B-DIS
very	I-DIS
soundly	I-DIS
.	O

Nothing	O
could	O
wake	O
you	O
.	O

Very	O
good	O
drug	O
while	O
you	O
are	O
getting	B-DIS
out	I-DIS
of	I-DIS
depression	I-DIS
and	O
anxiety	B-DIS

Responding	O
to	O
someone	O
who	O
wondered	O
what	O
would	O
happen	O
if	O
they	O
went	O
off	O
the	O
drug	O
.	O

I	O
used	O
it	O
to	O
lose	B-DIS
weight	I-DIS
for	O
my	O
daughter	O
'	O
s	O
wedding	O
but	O
when	O
I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
it	O
I	O
kept	O
exercising	O
and	O
eating	O
right	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
at	O
least	O
maintained	B-DIS
the	I-DIS
weight	I-DIS
loss	I-DIS
of	I-DIS
21	I-DIS
pounds	I-DIS
.	O

I	O
basically	O
used	O
it	O
to	O
jumpstart	O
me	O
at	O
a	O
point	O
where	O
I	O
had	O
plateaued	O
.	O

The	O
wedding	O
was	O
7	O
months	O
ago	O
and	O
I	O
have	O
long	O
since	O
lost	O
the	O
commitment	O
to	O
my	O
weight	B-DIS
loss	I-DIS
regime	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
did	O
gain	B-DIS
all	I-DIS
but	I-DIS
ten	I-DIS
pounds	I-DIS
back	I-DIS
.	O

Although	O
I	O
am	O
exercising	O
and	O
dieting	O
again	O
I	O
seem	O
to	O
be	O
"	O
stuck	O
",	O
so	O
my	O
doctor	O
gave	O
me	O
a	O
new	O
prescription	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
hoping	O
I	O
will	O
have	O
good	O
results	O
again	O
.	O

To	O
diet	O
and	O
exercise	O
faithfully	O
with	O
zero	O
results	O
is	O
discouraging	O
.	O

And	O
,	O
as	O
my	O
doctor	O
explained	O
,	O
this	O
drug	O
was	O
originally	O
developed	O
to	O
treat	O
depression	B-DIS
,	O
and	O
the	O
side	O
effect	O
was	O
weight	B-DIS
loss	I-DIS
,	O
so	O
they	O
started	O
to	O
market	O
it	O
for	O
weight	B-DIS
loss	I-DIS
purposes	O
instead	O
.	O

And	O
so	O
,	O
an	O
added	O
benefit	O
may	O
be	O
less	B-DIS
depression	I-DIS
,	O
but	O
who	O
knows	O
if	O
that	O
is	O
a	O
result	O
of	O
the	O
drug	O
or	O
a	O
result	O
of	O
looking	O
in	O
the	O

your	O

able	B-DIS
to	I-DIS
get	I-DIS
the	I-DIS

out	I-DIS
and	O
breath	B-DIS
normally	I-DIS

I	O
had	O
lost	O
a	O

When	O

disposition	I-DIS
,	O
the	O
pain	B-DIS
decreased	I-DIS

I	O
took	O
this	O
medication	O
not	O
for	O
depression	B-DIS
but	O
because	O
I	O
was	O
getting	O
a	O

blowing	I-DIS
up	I-DIS

In	O
the	O
