My	O

I	O
would	O
say	O
the	O
first	O

were	O
somewhat	O

and	O
unfortunately	O

this	O

I	O
take	O

I	O
will	O
be	O
asking	O
my	O

to	O
please	O
change	O
the	O
Nucynta	B-MED
as	O
the	O

are	O
not	O
worth	O
enduring	O
while	O
there	O
is	O
no	B-DIS

this	O
drug	O
was	O
prescribed	O
to	O
me	O
because	O
I	O
have	O
multiple	B-DIS
sclerosis	I-DIS

the	O

It	O

IBS	B-DIS
symptoms	I-DIS

I	O
was	O
put	O
on	O
20	O
mg	O
a	O
day	O

and	O
the	O
first	O

it	O
reduced	B-DIS
my	I-DIS
total	I-DIS
cholesterol	I-DIS
by	I-DIS
about	I-DIS
125	I-DIS

Soon	O
after	O
,	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
have	O
dizziness	B-DIS

headaches	B-DIS

then	O
a	O
progressively	O
worsening	O
weakness	B-DIS
in	I-DIS
my	I-DIS

and	O
severe	B-DIS
cramping	I-DIS

It	O
was	O

with	O
the	O
worst	O
pain	B-DIS
in	I-DIS
my	I-DIS
feet	I-DIS

which	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
acting	O

There	O
were	O
times	O

I	O

bend	I-DIS
over	I-DIS
at	O
the	O

and	O
a	O

of	O
times	O
when	O
I	O
didn	O
'	O
t	O
know	O
if	O
I	O
could	O
move	O
without	O
falling	O

It	O
was	O

telling	O
my	O
legs	O
to	O
move	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
refusing	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
also	O
taking	O
melodica	B-MED
for	O
arthritis	B-DIS
,	O
and	O
I	O
sent	O
a	O
message	O
to	O
my	O
doctor	O
that	O
I	O
thought	O
the	O
melodica	B-MED
was	O
causing	O
the	O
problems	O
.	O

I	O
didn	O
'	O
t	O
hear	O
anything	O
from	O
him	O
,	O
so	O
I	O
quit	O
the	O
melodica	B-MED
but	O
continued	O
with	O
the	O
simvastatin	B-MED
.	O

My	O
condition	O
got	O
worse	O
.	O

Then	O
I	O
just	O
quit	O
taking	O
the	O
simvastatin	B-MED
,	O
and	O
within	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
the	O
problems	O
began	O
to	O
clear	O
up	O
.	O

Every	O
day	O
since	O
,	O
things	O
have	O
gotten	O
better	O

and	O
I	O
am	O
back	O
on	O
the	O
melodica	B-MED
with	O
no	O
side	O
effects	O
.	O

I	O
conclude	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
simvastatin	B-MED
that	O
caused	O
the	O
problems	O
,	O
and	O
my	O
doctor	O
now	O
seems	O
to	O
agree	O

I	O

any	O

and	O
possibly	O
go	O
on	O
a	O
time	O
release	O
Niacin	B-MED

I	O
should	O

10	O
mg	O
Zocor	B-MED
many	O
years	O

no	O

I	O
urge	O
anyone	O
who	O
is	O
taking	O
either	O
Zocor	B-MED

the	O
generic	O
simvastatin	O
to	O
watch	O

carefully	O

was	O

Have	O
been	O
taking	O
the	O

It	O

rid	B-DIS
me	I-DIS
of	I-DIS

anxiety	I-DIS
which	O
I	O
am	O
very	O

Zoloft	B-MED
and	O
now	O
I	O
never	O
have	O
to	O
take	O
a	O
Xanax	B-MED
.	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
am	O
ready	O
to	O
come	O
off	O
this	O
medication	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
side	O
effects	O
.	O

At	O
first	O
it	O
was	O
just	O
an	O
odd	B-DIS
feeling	I-DIS
that	O
went	O
away	O
in	O
the	O
first	O
couple	O
weeks	O
.	O

Since	O
I	O
upped	O
my	O
dose	O
to	O
100mg	O
,	O
I	O
have	O
had	O
frequent	B-DIS
headaches	I-DIS

extreme	O
trouble	B-DIS
sleeping	I-DIS
at	O
night	O
(	O
falling	B-DIS

,	O
and	O
a	O
fluctuating	B-DIS
appetite	I-DIS
and	I-DIS
energy	I-DIS
level	I-DIS
.	O

I	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
start	O
gradually	O
coming	O
off	O
now	O
,	O
especially	O
since	O
I	O
hear	O
the	O
withdrawal	B-DIS
symptoms	I-DIS

I	O
got	O
an	O
infection	B-DIS
after	O
having	O
some	O
dental	O
work	O
done	O
and	O
this	O
was	O
prescribed	O
to	O
me	O
.	O

Horrible	O
.	O

The	O
pills	O
were	O
so	O
big	O
I	O
could	O
barely	O
swallow	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
could	O
deal	O
with	O
it	O
.	O

Then	O
on	O
my	O
3rd	O
day	O
of	O
taking	O
them	O
I	O
woke	O
up	O
at	O
3am	O
with	O
horrible	O
heartburn	B-DIS
,	O
nausea	B-DIS
,	O
and	O
the	O
worst	B-DIS
taste	I-DIS
ever	I-DIS
in	I-DIS
my	I-DIS
mouth	I-DIS

I	O
'	O
m	O
being	O
put	O
on	O
a	O
different	O
medication	O
,	O
now	O
and	O
will	O
never	O
take	O
this	O
again	O
.	O

I	O
even	O
followed	O
all	O
the	O
directions	O
,	O
ate	O
yogurt	O
,	O
drank	O
extra	O
water	O
...	O
Now	O
I	O
can	B-DIS
'	I-DIS
t	I-DIS
even	I-DIS
take	I-DIS
anything	I-DIS
for	I-DIS
pain	I-DIS

I	O
take	O
nucynta	B-MED
for	O
severe	B-DIS
back	I-DIS
pain	I-DIS
and	O
sciatica	B-DIS
.	O

I	O
only	O
take	O
it	O
occasionally	O
,	O
not	O
regularly	O
,	O
because	O
it	O
makes	O
me	O
too	O
groggy	B-DIS
to	I-DIS
work	I-DIS
or	I-DIS
drive	I-DIS
.	O

I	O
work	O
as	O
an	O
editor	O
so	O
I	O
only	O
take	O
it	O
at	O
night	O
and	O
then	O
rarely	O
because	O
the	O
next	O
day	O
I	O
feel	B-DIS
sleepy	I-DIS
and	O
tired	B-DIS
.	O

It	O
is	O
usually	O
effective	O
,	O
but	O
there	O
are	O
times	O
when	O
nothing	O
helps	O
the	O
pain	B-DIS
.	O

It	O
is	O
more	O
effective	O
than	O
anything	O
else	O
the	O
doctors	O
have	O
prescribed	O
.	O

I	O
just	O
can	O
'	O
t	O
use	O
it	O
regularly	O
because	O
I	O
need	O
to	O
stay	O
alert	O
,	O
so	O
mostly	O
I	O
just	O
try	O
to	O
endure	O
my	O
pain	B-DIS
.	O

I	O
do	O
have	O
other	O
health	B-DIS
problems	I-DIS

such	O
as	O

as	O
well	O
as	O
heart	B-DIS
problems	I-DIS
and	O
obesity	B-DIS

and	O
it	O
is	O
contraindicated	O
for	O
these	O
,	O
but	O
so	O
far	O
I	O
have	O
not	O
had	O
any	O
problems	O
other	O
than	O
sleepiness	B-DIS

These	O

are	O
the	O

that	O
I	O

Dr	O

stop	O
taking	O
the	O
Zocor	B-MED
,	O
I	O
will	O
try	O
another	O

drug	O

This	O
medication	O
was	O
suggested	O
by	O
my	O
ENT	O
doctor	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
stop	B-DIS
my	I-DIS
cough	I-DIS
,	O
which	O
resulted	O
from	O
my	O
production	O
of	O
constant	B-DIS
mucous	I-DIS
.	O

It	O
works	O
quite	O
well	O
,	O
and	O
relieves	B-DIS
the	I-DIS
cough	I-DIS
.	O

However	O
,	O
after	O
one	O
week	O
of	O
using	O
the	O
highest	O
recommended	O
dosage	O
,	O
I	O
developed	O
diarrhea	B-DIS

This	O
has	O
been	O
reported	O
by	O

I	O
have	O
no	O

when	O

mucinex	B-MED

two	O

at	O
the	O

But	O
after	O
one	O
week	O
,	O
I	O
experienced	O
nausea	B-DIS
and	O
diarrhea	B-DIS
.	O

This	O
is	O
unfortunate	O
because	O
the	O
drug	O
works	O
quite	O
well	O
to	O
accomplish	O
the	O
objective	O
of	O
reducing	O

I	O
have	O
