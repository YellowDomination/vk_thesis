So	O
I	O

There	O
has	O
been	O
no	O
side	O

I	O
take	O
about	O
15	O

I	O
'	O

had	O
these	O
two	O
problem	O
for	O
about	O
2	O
years	O

one	O
thing	O
the	O
doctors	O
don	O
'	O
t	O
tell	O
you	O
is	O
these	O
drugs	O
ARE	O
NOT	O
cures	O
but	O
are	O
the	O
lesser	O
of	O
two	O
evils	O
...	O
especially	O
the	O
benzol	O

I	O
have	O
had	O
no	O

three	O

with	O
no	O

whatever	O

(	O
This	O
lack	O
of	O
side	O
effects	O
is	O
surprising	O
for	O
me	O
,	O
because	O
most	O

give	O
me	O
the	O
jitters	O
,	O
etc	O
.)	O

I	O
smoked	O
for	O
38	O
years	O
and	O
I	O
damaged	B-DIS
my	I-DIS
lungs	I-DIS
,	O
so	O
now	O
I	O
have	O
too	O
much	O
mucous	B-DIS
in	I-DIS
my	I-DIS

I	O
can	B-DIS

up	I-DIS
enough	O
to	O

my	I-DIS

When	O
I	O
started	O
taking	O
it	O

I	O
expected	O
to	O
cough	B-DIS
up	I-DIS
a	O
bunch	O
of	O

but	O
for	O
me	O
the	O
effect	O
was	O
different	O

the	O
Mucinex	B-MED
apparently	O
dilutes	O

out	I-DIS
the	I-DIS

that	O
it	O

I	O
get	O
really	O
bad	O
night	B-DIS
sweats	I-DIS
and	O
seem	O
to	O
go	O
through	O
different	O
levels	B-DIS
of	I-DIS

I	O
have	O

on	O
this	O
medication	O

If	O

will	O
have	O
extreme	O
anxiety	B-DIS

found	O
to	O

as	O

needed	O
,	O
it	O
is	O
better	O
to	O

The	O
only	O
reason	O
I	O
gave	O
three	O

I	O
have	O
always	O
been	O
a	O

this	O
was	O

I	O
weaned	O
myself	O
off	O
Lexapro	B-MED

then	O
experienced	O
a	O

in	O

considering	O
I	O

I	O
would	O

Lexapro	B-MED
was	O
great	O
while	O
it	O

I	O
first	O
noticed	O
hip	B-DIS
pain	I-DIS
after	O
excercise	O
and	O
middle	O
of	O
the	O
night	B-DIS
leg	I-DIS
cramps	I-DIS

I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
it	O
around	O
3	O
months	O

because	O
of	O
extreme	O
hip	B-DIS
pain	I-DIS

I	O
can	B-DIS
hardly	I-DIS

off	I-DIS

I	O
must	O

rest	O
when	O
on	O
a	O

The	O
extreme	O
hip	B-DIS
pain	I-DIS
has	I-DIS
subsided	I-DIS
somewhat	O
but	O
not	O
enough	O
to	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
enjoy	O
a	O
walk	O
or	O
even	O
due	O
my	O
housework	O
.	O

I	O
wish	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
paid	O
more	O
attention	O
to	O
what	O
my	O
body	B-DIS
was	I-DIS
screaming	I-DIS
.	O

I	O
pray	O
that	O
this	O
pain	B-DIS
will	O
go	O
away	O
but	O
I	O
am	O
very	O
concerned	O
.	O

I	O
know	O
my	O
doctor	O
will	O
want	O
to	O
tests	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
know	O
crestor	B-MED

I	O
found	O
this	O
drug	O
to	O
be	O
very	O
effective	O
.	O

I	O
purchased	O
the	O
one	O
used	O
to	O
treat	O
irritated	B-DIS
bronchial	I-DIS
tubes	I-DIS
to	O
relieve	B-DIS
cough	I-DIS
and	O
to	O
thin	B-DIS
mucus	I-DIS
.	O

This	O
worked	O
great	O
for	O
me	O
in	O
a	O
very	O
short	O
time	O
and	O
I	O
feel	O
certain	O
kept	O
my	O
illness	B-DIS
from	O
turning	O
into	O
something	O
more	O
serious	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
not	O
used	O
the	O
one	O
which	O
is	O
for	O
chest	B-DIS
congestion	I-DIS

I	O
have	O
Gerd	B-DIS
and	O
I	O
cannot	O
take	O
too	O
much	O
of	O
this	O
.	O

What	O
I	O
found	O
effective	O
is	O
to	O
take	O
2	O
.	O
5	O
mg	O
under	O
the	O
tongue	O
which	O
works	O
in	O
about	O
30	O
min	O
.	O

But	O
I	O
wake	O
up	O
half	O
way	O
through	O
the	O
night	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
bathroom	O
.	O

So	O
I	O
take	O
another	O
2	O
.	O
5	O
mg	O
under	O
the	O
tongue	O
and	O
all	O
is	O
great	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
I	O
alternate	O
nights	O
with	O
10	O
mg	O
of	O
Melatonin	B-MED
because	O
the	O
Zolpidem	B-MED
exacerbates	B-DIS
the	I-DIS
gerd	I-DIS
and	O
also	O
makes	O
me	O
very	O
tired	B-DIS
throughout	O
the	O
day	O
.	O

So	O
only	O
doing	O
a	O
total	O
of	O
5	O
mg	O
three	O
times	O
a	O
week	O
then	O
alternating	O
with	O
10mg	O
of	O
melatonin	B-MED
3x	O
per	O
week	O
is	O
much	O
easier	O
on	O
my	O
system	O
.	O

Not	O

taking	O
this	O
under	O
the	O
tongue	O
is	O
bad	O

unfortunately	O
in	O

Sleep	B-DIS
tight	I-DIS

Worked	O
very	O
well	O
,	O
but	O
after	O
a	O
week	O
I	O
averaged	B-DIS
about	I-DIS
an	I-DIS
hour	I-DIS
of	I-DIS
sleep	I-DIS
a	I-DIS
night	I-DIS
.	O

My	O
doctor	O
pulled	O
me	O
off	O
of	O
it	O
because	O
of	O
this	O
.	O

If	O
you	O
are	O
able	B-DIS
to	I-DIS
sleep	I-DIS
at	I-DIS
night	I-DIS

This	O
medication	O
was	O
prescribed	O
to	O
treat	O
my	O
parasomnia	B-DIS
.	O

I	O
sleep	B-DIS
walk	I-DIS
nightly	I-DIS
and	O
often	O
wake	O
up	O
feeling	B-DIS
anxious	I-DIS
and	O
exhausted	B-DIS
.	O

Not	O
to	O
mention	O
the	O
embarrassing	O
stories	O
that	O
my	O
husband	O
loves	O
to	O
recount	O
.	O

I	O
have	O
only	O
been	O
on	O
it	O
a	O
month	O
but	O
so	O
far	O
it	O
has	O
completely	O
controlled	B-DIS
my	I-DIS
sleep	I-DIS
walking	I-DIS
and	O
anxiety	B-DIS
with	O
no	O
side	O
effects	O
.	O

I	O
awake	O
feeling	B-DIS
well	I-DIS
rested	I-DIS

I	O
started	O
taking	O
Mucinex	B-MED
DM	I-MED
when	O
the	O
congestion	B-DIS
went	I-DIS
from	I-DIS
my	I-DIS
head	I-DIS
to	I-DIS
my	I-DIS
chest	I-DIS
causing	O
bronchitis	B-DIS
.	O

So	O
far	O
,	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
the	O
only	O
medication	O
that	O
has	O
helped	O
with	O
bronchitis	B-DIS

It	O
is	O
much	O
harder	B-DIS
to	I-DIS
cough	I-DIS
up	I-DIS
mucus	I-DIS
from	I-DIS
the	I-DIS
lungs	I-DIS
when	O
you	O
have	O
emphysema	B-DIS
,	O
and	O
this	O
makes	O
it	O
a	O
lot	O
easier	O
for	O
me	O
,	O
as	O
it	O
takes	O
less	O
effort	O
to	O
clear	B-DIS
lungs	I-DIS

For	O
the	O
last	O
30	O
years	O
I	O
have	O
tried	O
about	O
every	O
anti	O

medication	O
my	O
psychologists	O

nothing	O

the	O

I	O
have	O
tried	O
other	O

and	O
get	O
the	O

them	O

Maybe	O
it	O
is	O
a	O

Ill	B-DIS

with	O

almost	O
10	O
years	O

After	O
trying	O
several	O
medications	O
celesta	B-MED
finally	O
lifted	B-DIS
me	I-DIS
out	I-DIS
of	I-DIS
the	I-DIS
depths	I-DIS
of	I-DIS

with	O
fewer	O

much	I-DIS
better	I-DIS
after	O
being	O
on	O
this	O

for	O
a	O

I	O
decided	O
to	O
wean	O

off	O
it	O

bad	O
move	O
as	O
I	O
experienced	O
such	O
a	O
bad	O
relapse	B-DIS
of	I-DIS

I	O
thought	O
I	O

Be	O
careful	O
about	O
going	O
off	O
your	O
meds	O
without	O

it	O
was	O
a	O

for	O

after	I-DIS

One	O
thing	O
for	O

celesta	B-MED

Although	O
this	O

side	O
effects	O

The	O
benefits	O
out	O

the	O

of	O
side	O

The	O
first	O
day	O
on	O
the	O
medication	O
I	O
had	O
night	B-DIS

and	O
couldn	B-DIS
'	I-DIS

By	O
the	O
second	O
day	O
I	O
was	O
able	B-DIS

I	O
had	O

I	O
have	O
fibromyalgia	B-DIS

illnesses	B-DIS

I	O
have	O
had	O
difficulty	B-DIS
sleeping	I-DIS
for	O
decades	O

Approximately	O
10	O
years	O
ago	O
my	O
physician	O
prescribed	O
me	O
Ambien	B-MED
at	O
5	O
mg	O

I	O
began	O
taking	O
it	O
and	O
was	O
able	B-DIS
to	I-DIS
get	I-DIS
6	I-DIS
hours	I-DIS
of	I-DIS
solid	I-DIS
sleep	I-DIS
.	O

As	O
time	O
went	O
by	O
,	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
increase	O
the	O
dosage	O
to	O
10	O
mg	O
.	O

I	O
found	O
that	O
when	O
I	O
took	O
the	O
drug	O
nightly	O
,	O
many	O
mornings	O
I	O
awoke	B-DIS
in	I-DIS
a	I-DIS
fog	I-DIS
and	O
disoriented	B-DIS
,	O
very	O
fatigued	B-DIS

It	O
was	O

that	O
I	O
take	O
the	O
drug	O
only	O
as	O
needed	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
unable	B-DIS
to	I-DIS
fall	I-DIS
asleep	I-DIS
on	O
my	O

This	O
has	O
worked	O
out	O

better	O
for	O

now	O

I	O
don	O

Ambien	B-MED

it	O

too	O

for	O
me	O
and	O
left	O
me	O
in	O
a	O
constant	B-DIS
fog	I-DIS

I	O
felt	B-DIS
like	I-DIS
a	I-DIS

on	O
CR	B-MED

This	O
drug	O
was	O
Horrible	O

With	O

It	O
was	O
significantly	O

(	O
from	O

it	O

well	O
to	O
manage	O
my	O
back	B-DIS

from	O
a	O
bulging	B-DIS
disc	I-DIS

The	O
side	O
effects	O
have	O
been	O
very	O
minor	O
in	O
my	O
case	O

My	O
pain	B-DIS
is	I-DIS
not	I-DIS
completely	I-DIS
gone	I-DIS

but	O
it	O
is	O
masked	B-DIS

reduced	I-DIS
a	O

It	O
has	O

not	O

my	O
brain	B-DIS
as	I-DIS
"	I-DIS
foggy	I-DIS
"	I-DIS
as	O
other	O
pain	O
meds	O

Also	O
,	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
a	O
lot	O
easier	B-DIS
on	I-DIS
my	I-DIS
stomach	I-DIS
than	O
other	O
pain	O
meds	O

My	O
doctor	O
initially	O
prescribed	O
10	O
mg	O
of	O
Crestor	B-MED

Shortly	O
after	O
I	O
became	O
aware	O
of	O
severe	B-DIS
leg	I-DIS
and	I-DIS
back	I-DIS
pain	I-DIS
,	O
but	O
did	O
not	O

it	O

I	O
also	O

On	O
Oct	O

and	O
recent	O
edema	B-DIS
in	I-DIS
my	I-DIS

He	O
did	O
not	O
consider	O
this	O
significant	O

After	O
another	O
blood	O
test	O
showed	O
my	O
cholesterol	B-DIS
went	I-DIS
down	I-DIS
from	I-DIS
over	I-DIS
300	I-DIS
to	I-DIS
247	I-DIS
,	O
he	O
still	O
felt	B-DIS
that	I-DIS
was	I-DIS

increased	O
my	O
dose	O
to	O
20	O

Since	O

the	O
