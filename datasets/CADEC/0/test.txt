my	O

I	O
found	O
that	O

so	O
I	O
switched	O
to	O
the	O
600mg	O

If	O

far	O
in	O
stopping	B-DIS
my	I-DIS

I	O
also	O
was	O
in	O
a	O
ridiculous	O
relationship	O
with	O
a	O
man	O
that	O
I	O
never	O
would	O
have	O
been	O
with	O
if	O
not	O
for	O
the	O
xanax	B-MED
.	O

I	O
found	O
that	O
I	O
loved	O
everyone	O
,	O
the	O
world	O
was	O
rosy	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
didn	O
'	O
t	O
really	O
give	O
a	O
fig	O
about	O
anything	O

Now	O
I	O
cannot	B-DIS
get	I-DIS
off	I-DIS
this	O

After	O
all	O
these	O
years	O
of	O
being	O
medicated	O
,	O
I	O
have	O
no	O
idea	O
what	O
my	O
real	O
personality	O
is	O
,	O
and	O
often	O
wonder	O
how	O
different	O
my	O
life	O
would	O
have	O
turned	O
out	O
without	O
xanax	B-MED

This	O
medicine	O
works	O
great	O
to	O
break	B-DIS
down	I-DIS
a	I-DIS
cough	I-DIS
.	O

The	O
only	O
side	O
effects	O
I	O
'	O
ve	O
experienced	O
is	O
I	O
get	O
light	B-DIS
headed	I-DIS

I	O
came	O
down	O
with	O
Flu	B-DIS
like	I-DIS
symptoms	I-DIS

quickly	O
...	O
fever	B-DIS
,	O
chills	B-DIS

Also	O
have	O
a	O
bad	O
cough	B-DIS
with	I-DIS
upper	I-DIS
respiratory	I-DIS
issues	I-DIS

After	O
taking	O
Mucinex	B-MED
DM	I-MED
my	O
cough	B-DIS
was	I-DIS
producing	I-DIS
and	O
much	O
needed	O
loosening	O
of	O
mucus	B-DIS
build	I-DIS
up	I-DIS
in	I-DIS
my	I-DIS
chest	I-DIS
.	O

Yes	O
,	O
I	O
was	O
tired	O
while	O
taking	O
it	O
,	O
but	O
I	O
attribute	O
this	O
to	O
just	O
being	B-DIS
sick	I-DIS

I	O
took	O
this	O
for	O
2	O
months	O
only	O
and	O
lost	B-DIS
26	I-DIS
lbs	I-DIS
.	O

It	O
really	O
worked	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
not	O
a	O
magic	O
pill	O
I	O
worked	O
out	O
5	O
days	O
a	O

It	O
does	O
make	O
your	O
mouth	B-DIS
